        After installing GLPK 5.0, run:

GLPK uses 1-based indexing for its arrays. But since C has 0-based indexing, all
1-based vectors passed to GLPK need to be padded with a "0'th" element that will
never be accessed. To avoid doing this padding in Julia, we convert the vector
to a reference, and use the optional second argument to ensure the reference
points to the "0'th" element of the array. This is safe to do, provided C never
accesses `x[0]`.

See the GLPK manual for more details.
